One can find the settings for the viewport shading in the top right corner of the 3D viewport. These are the shading modes available from left to right:

- Wireframe
- Solid
- Material preview
- Rendered

We suggests to use ``Material preview`` shading for structure viewing and material setting. Use ``Solid`` shading for structure editing, especially for large system (> 10000 atoms). Use ``Rendered`` for lighting setup and rendering.


For each viewport shading, one can find its setting by expand the viewport shading menu.

For example, in solid shading, there are four sections:

- Lighting
- Color
- Background
- Options
