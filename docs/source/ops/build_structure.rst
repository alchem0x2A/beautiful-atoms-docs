Molecule
=========

The G2-database of common molecules is available.



Bulk
=========

Creating bulk systems.

Crystal structure and lattice constant(s) will be guessed if not provided.


Surface
============
A number of utility functions are provided to set up the most common surfaces, to add vacuum layers, and to add adsorbates to a surface. In general, all surfaces can be set up with the modules described in the section General crystal structures and surfaces, but these utility functions make common tasks easier.
