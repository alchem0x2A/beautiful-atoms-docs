Geometry Node
=====================

Periodic boundary condition
-------------------------------

- support switch on and off. It seems that nodes not connected to main flow will not be evaluated, thus we can simply disconnect the "position" socket to switch it off.
- support selection for atoms
- support pbc for 1D, 2D and 3D
